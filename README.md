### wiki-cli

this is a project study I'm doing to parser some html from wikipedia
to maximize my time when remembering simple concepts

### ToDo List

- [ ] Add Results to my functions to handle better errors
- [ ] Use some parsing combinators to match html attributes better
- [ ] Decide how the integrations with wikipedia will happen

### Done

- [x] Create a Node tree for html
