### wiki-cli

this is a project study I'm doing to parser some html from wikipedia
to maximize my time when remembering simple concepts.

the usage of parsing combinators I took from the great tutorial wrote by [Bodil](https://github.com/bodil):
https://bodil.lol/parser-combinators/#footnote_1
I learned a lot reading his article, it's really awesome!
